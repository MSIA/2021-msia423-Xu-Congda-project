# NCAA March Madness Bracket Predictor

## Vision
Each year when the NCAA Tournament comes, people get super excited about this feast of basketball. In addition to the games, an important part of March Madness is the bracket challenge, which is an activity to make predictions of the game results. Friends set up groups and compete against each other by trying to fill up a bracket with the highest accuracy. When filling up the brackets, people always find it hard to make a choice: they might be unfamiliar with the teams, or the two teams in a matchup are so close in terms of competitiveness. Therefore, I would like to develop an app that can predict the how far a team can proceed in the tournament (e.g., Sweet Sixteen, Elite Eight, Final Four), and the game result of a certain matchup. I hope this app can provide great assistance to people that are suffering from tough choices when filling the brackets, and provide some insights to audiences that are unfamiliar with the teams before the tournament begins.


## Mission
The app will offer two options to the users:
Option #1: The user selects a team, and the app returns the predicted performance of the team in this year's NCAA Tournament (e.g., Sweet Sixteen, Elite Eight, Final Four).
Option #2: The user select the two teams of a certain matchup, and the app will predict the winner of the matchup.

Regarding the data source, I would use the March Machine Learning Mania 2021 - NCAAM dataset on Kaggle. The link to the dataset is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ncaam-march-mania-2021/data). 

The current data source provides a variety and sufficient amount of data, including statistics of regular season and tournament for all teams in NCAA Division I for men, ranging from 2003 to 2020. There are some data cleaning needs to be done. The dataset is separated into multiple files, and I need to link them together, filter out the data I need, and make necessary aggregations. In addition, I need to transform certain data for feature engineering.

To enable the first option, I plan to train a multi-class classification model such as KNN. To enable the second option, I plan to train a binary classification model such as logistic regression or SVM or Neural Network. The specific model that I would used for the final app will depend on the performance of the model.


## Success Criteria
**Machine Learning Performance Metric:**

 - Accuracy: Since I am implemeting two classification models, accuracy is going to be an appropriate metric to judge the predicive power of the models. The most basic benchmark accuracy should be 50% (random guess probability), which is a bottom line that my model should surpass, and the model accuracy is definitely the higher the better.

**Business Metric**

 - % Increase of app user for each NCAA season
 - Ranking of the app-generated full-bracket score when compared with the real brackets that people fill for each NCAA tournament

## Running the app
### 1. Initialize the database 

#### Create the database 
To create the database in the location configured in `config.py` run: 

`python run.py create_db --engine_string=<engine_string>`

By default, `python run.py create_db` creates a database at `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Adding songs 
To add songs to the database:

`python run.py ingest --engine_string=<engine_string> --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

By default, `python run.py ingest` adds *Minor Cause* by Emancipator to the SQLite database located in `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Defining your engine string 
A SQLAlchemy database connection is defined by a string with the following format:

`dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`

The `+dialect` is optional and if not provided, a default is used. For a more detailed description of what `dialect` and `driver` are and how a connection is made, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html). We will cover SQLAlchemy and connection strings in the SQLAlchemy lab session on 
##### Local SQLite database 

A local SQLite database can be created for development and local testing. It does not require a username or password and replaces the host and port with the path to the database file: 

```python
engine_string='sqlite:///data/tracks.db'

```

The three `///` denote that it is a relative path to where the code is being run (which is from the root of this directory).

You can also define the absolute path with four `////`, for example:

```python
engine_string = 'sqlite://///Users/cmawer/Repos/2020-MSIA423-template-repository/data/tracks.db'
```


### 2. Configure Flask app 

`config/flaskconfig.py` holds the configurations for the Flask app. It includes the following configurations:

```python
DEBUG = True  # Keep True for debugging, change to False when moving to production 
LOGGING_CONFIG = "config/logging/local.conf"  # Path to file that configures Python logger
HOST = "0.0.0.0" # the host that is running the app. 0.0.0.0 when running locally 
PORT = 5000  # What port to expose app on. Must be the same as the port exposed in app/Dockerfile 
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///data/tracks.db'  # URI (engine string) for database that contains tracks
APP_NAME = "penny-lane"
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True 
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False  # If true, SQL for queries made will be printed
MAX_ROWS_SHOW = 100 # Limits the number of rows returned from the database 
```

### 3. Run the Flask app 

To run the Flask app, run: 

```bash
python app.py
```

You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

## Running the app in Docker 

### 1. Build the image 

The Dockerfile for running the flask app is in the `app/` folder. To build the image, run from this directory (the root of the repo): 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile -t pennylane .
```

This command builds the Docker image, with the tag `pennylane`, based on the instructions in `app/Dockerfile` and the files existing in this directory.
 
### 2. Run the container 

To run the app, run from this directory: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane
```
You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

This command runs the `pennylane` image as a container named `test` and forwards the port 5000 from container to your laptop so that you can access the flask app exposed through that port. 

If `PORT` in `config/flaskconfig.py` is changed, this port should be changed accordingly (as should the `EXPOSE 5000` line in `app/Dockerfile`)

### 3. Kill the container 

Once finished with the app, you will need to kill the container. To do so: 

```bash
docker kill test 
```

where `test` is the name given in the `docker run` command.

### Example using `python3` as an entry point

We have included another example of a Dockerfile, `app/Dockerfile_python` that has `python3` as the entry point such that when you run the image as a container, the command `python3` is run, followed by the arguments given in the `docker run` command after the image name. 

To build this image: 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_python -t pennylane .
```

then run the `docker run` command: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane app.py
```

The new image defines the entry point command as `python3`. Building the sample PennyLane image this way will require initializing the database prior to building the image so that it is copied over, rather than created when the container is run. Therefore, please **do the step [Create the database with a single song](#create-the-database-with-a-single-song) above before building the image**.

# Testing

From within the Docker container, the following command should work to run unit tests when run from the root of the repository: 

```bash
python -m pytest
``` 

Using Docker, run the following, if the image has not been built yet:

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_python -t pennylane .
```

To run the tests, run: 

```bash
 docker run penny -m pytest
```
